A bunch of elevevators in a building, a bunch of people trying to move up and down. You have to controll each elevator individually.

MVP:
A single elevator. Move up, down, open/close doors.
A building with 2 floors.
A person that gets on the elevator if the doors are open on floor 1, and gets off if the doors open on floor 2.
